# Credit Card Fraud Prediction.
Predicting whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. This binary classification problem is set with over 500k observations that are highly skewed towards not being fraudulent. We consider multiple models, and different misclassification weights in order to reduce the false negative rate. 

In order to run this code, please be mindful that some of the code will take a while to compile, in some cases more than two hours if not parallel processing. Since we build with Decision Trees and Random forests in most cases, it will not be much of an issue. However, much of the issues arise while attempting to compile the Ensemble boosting algorithm.
